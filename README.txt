#problem statement
1.The objective is to provide an effective and robust approach to detect and classify defects on material surface using computer vision and machine learning, thereby comparing various metrics to decide with algorithm works best.
2.The input is taken from the DAGM challenge, which is available online. This database contains six classes of defects each containing 1000 non-defective images and 150 defective images for each class.
#Dataset
1.The provided data is artificially generated, but similar to real world problems. It consists of multiple data sets, each consisting of 1000 images showing the background texture without defects, and of 150 images with one labeled defect each on the background texture. The images in a single data set are very similar, but each data set is generated by a different texture model and defect model.
